BUGFIXES
--------

Since First appearance (10 november 1997)
-----------------------------------------
* The doc files of JV_Float showed traces of copy pasting from
JV_Float. At some places Integer has been replaced by Float
* The wrapper of floats was wrongly generated because it refered
to JV_Integer. It was therefore not possible to invoke abs,sqrt
and sqr on floats
* Sending SUPER to reifier messages didn't work (like SELF
SUPER).
* Worked around the bug in the JDK Java interpreter. Multiple
lines of text can now also be evaluated.

Version 14 nov97 -> Version 17 nov97
-------------------------------------
* Now it *should* be possible to have multiple lines of text in every VM.
Fixed the bug in the workaround of the bug :-)
* Implemented a DumpImage and ReadImage. Agora can now be serialized.
